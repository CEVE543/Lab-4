# Lab 4: Bayesian Rainfall Analysis

**Date:** September 19, 2025 | **Module:** 1 | **Week:** 4

## Overview

This lab builds on the previous GEV inference techniques by introducing Bayesian modeling approaches for extreme value analysis. Students will learn to set up Bayesian GEV models, develop strategies for prior specification, and use these tools to compare rainfall patterns between two stations.

## Topics Covered

- Bayesian GEV model setup with Turing.jl
- Prior specification strategies for extreme value parameters
- Two-station comparison problem using Bayesian inference
- Model comparison and selection techniques
- Posterior predictive checking

## Objectives

- Set up Bayesian GEV models with informative priors
- Develop strategies for prior specification in extreme value analysis
- Compare rainfall patterns between two stations using Bayesian inference
- Understand the advantages of Bayesian approaches for uncertainty quantification

## Connection to Problem Sets

This lab builds the Bayesian GEV toolkit that students will use for PS1 Tasks 1-2, providing the foundation for sophisticated statistical modeling of extreme rainfall events with proper uncertainty quantification.
